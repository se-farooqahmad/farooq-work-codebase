## Getting Started

These steps will help you set up and explore the repository locally:

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/se-farooqahmad/farooq-work-codebase.git
cd farooq-work-codebase
```

### Explore
Browse project directories to view individual code files and their associated documentation (if any). Many folders include source code in languages such as C++, Python, Assembly, etc.

## Usage

Since this repository contains multiple independent projects, usage varies per folder. In general:

1. **Navigate to the desired project folder.**
2. **Compile or run code** according to the language:

**For C++ projects**
```sh
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

**For Python notebooks**
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

**For HTML/JS files**  
Open them in your browser.

Include specific instructions per project where needed for clarity.
